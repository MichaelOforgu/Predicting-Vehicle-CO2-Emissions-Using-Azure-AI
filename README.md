# ðŸš— Predicting Vehicle COâ‚‚ Emissions Using Azure AI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **COâ‚‚ emissions** from vehicles using a **Machine Learning model built entirely on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio**. The aim is to utilize vehicle specifications to accurately forecast the amount of COâ‚‚ emitted, supporting environmentally conscious decision-making and regulatory compliance.

The model uses a **Linear Regression algorithm** due to the continuous nature of the target variable (COâ‚‚ emissions in grams per kilometre). The solution pipeline includes data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment for real-time inference.

## ðŸ”§ Azure ML Studio Pipeline (Training Workflow)

![Screenshot 2025-03-28 at 13 26 48](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f9f6d07-e522-4746-9630-8f6a2a221fbf)

### 1. **Dataset Upload & Preview**
The dataset was uploaded to Azure ML Studio and inspected using the built-in **Data Preview** tool to verify data quality and column metadata.

### 2. **Select Columns in Dataset**
Only the most relevant features were selected for model training to avoid noise and redundancy. Columns such as `Make` and `Model` (categorical with high cardinality) may be excluded or encoded accordingly.

### 3. **Clean Missing Data**
Missing values were handled using Azure's preprocessing module. Strategies include:
- Removing rows with nulls
- Imputing numerical columns using mean or median
- Ensuring consistency of categorical data

### 4. **Normalize Data**
Numerical features such as `Engine Size`, `Fuel Consumption`, and `Cylinders` were normalized to ensure equal weighting in the linear regression model.

### 5. **Split Data**
The dataset was split into **training (70%)** and **testing (30%)** sets to evaluate model generalization and prevent overfitting.

### 6. **Select Algorithm: Linear Regression**
Linear Regression was chosen as the baseline model to predict continuous COâ‚‚ values. It calculates a line of best fit by minimizing the error between predicted and actual values.

### 7. **Train Model**
The training module was connected to the linear regression model and the preprocessed training dataset. The model learned the relationships between vehicle features and COâ‚‚ emissions.

### 8. **Score Model**
The model was applied to the test dataset to generate predicted COâ‚‚ emission values.

### 9. **Evaluate Model**
Model performance was evaluated using:
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
- **RÂ²** Score (Coefficient of Determination)
These metrics provide insights into model accuracy and performance.

## ðŸš€ Azure ML Studio Inference Pipeline (Deployment Workflow)

![Screenshot 2025-03-28 at 13 27 24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2c077fe-0fb6-4bd8-8da6-6fb861c74a0c)


### 1. **Enter Data Manually**
A manual input module was used to simulate real-world data entry (e.g., for a new car).

### 2. **Preprocessing via Apply Transformation**
Same preprocessing steps (normalization, column selection) from training were reused to maintain consistency.

### 3. **Model Scoring**
The trained model was used to score new incoming data and generate predictions for COâ‚‚ emissions.

### 4. **Execute Python Script**
A custom Python script processed and formatted the scored results, readying them for output or further analysis.

### 5. **Web Service Output**
The model was deployed as a **RESTful web service**, enabling integration with external systems or user interfaces for real-time predictions.
